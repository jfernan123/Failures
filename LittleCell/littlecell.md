----------- Little Cell ---------------
Goal: Create a little cell in a 10x10 grid that can learn to survive by feeding itself on randomly distributed food in the top right corner

How I did it: 
I used expected sarsa to learn the value function of the 10x10 grid in an attempt to make the cell learn the overall location of food. I used
an epsilon greedy policy

Why I failed: While the cell can survive
